        Set( %ElapsedBusinessTime,
            Start   => '08:30',
            End     => '17:30',
            Country => undef,
            Region  => undef,
            'Exclude Days'   => [6, 7],
            'Exclude States' => ['stalled', 'blocked', 'resolved', 'rejected', 'deleted'],
        );

    Options are:

    Start
        The start of the business day.

    End The end of the business day.

    Country
        A country for which there is a Date::Holidays module which describes
        the holidays for that country. If there isn't one, please consider
        writing one! For example 'NZ' for New Zealand.

    Region
        Some country modules for Date::Holidays include regions for regional
        holidays. For example 'Wellington' within New Zealand for Wellington
        Anniversary Day.

    Excluded Days
        Days which should not be considered working days. The day numbers
        are from DateTime. For reference they are:

            1: Monday
            2: Tuesday
            3: Wednesday
            4: Thursday
            5: Friday
            6: Saturday
            7: Sunday

    Excluded States
        Which a ticket is in one of these states, then it is considered
        inactive and the counter stops. This is to allow when a ticket is
        waiting on a customers feedback, and for some businesses, that time
        shouldn't be added to their ticket duration time.

DISPLAY COLUMNS
    There are three display columns which this extension adds, which all
    show the same information, just in different formats:

    ElapsedBussinessHours
    ElapsedBussinessMinutes
    ElapsedBussinessTime
